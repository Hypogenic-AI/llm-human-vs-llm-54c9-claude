Research Topic: Do LLMs behave differently when the prompter is human vs another LLM?

Key Resources:
- Literature Review: literature_review.md
- Resource Catalog: resources.md
- Papers: papers/ (9 PDFs with papers/README.md)
- Datasets: datasets/ (3 datasets with datasets/README.md)
- Code: code/ (3 repositories with code/README.md)

Critical Findings from Literature:
1. Human and AI text have distinct stylistic signatures (HC3, RAID)
2. LLMs adapt behavior based on perceived user preferences (Sycophancy paper)
3. LLMs are influenced by source authority and confidence (Influence paper)
4. Multi-agent LLM systems use different communication patterns

Recommended Experimental Approach:
1. Create controlled prompt pairs (human-style vs LLM-style)
2. Test multiple LLMs with both prompt types
3. Measure behavioral differences using adapted sycophancy metrics
4. Statistical analysis of response variations

This phase is complete. The experiment runner can now proceed with implementation.
